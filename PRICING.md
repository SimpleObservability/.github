## FAQ

### Do I get a license key or activation code?
**No.** This is a trust-based system. You receive confirmation via email that you're licensed. There's no DRM or activation mechanism.

### What if my company grows beyond the small business threshold?
You have 30 days from crossing the threshold (250 employees or $1M revenue) to purchase a Commercial License. Contact us - we're reasonable people!

### Can I try before I buy?
**Absolutely!** Use the Community License for evaluation. Once you determine it meets your needs and you're ready for commercial use, purchase a license.

### What if I'm a startup?
If you're under the small business thresholds (<250 employees, <$1M revenue), you qualify for the free Community License. Once you grow beyond that, we're happy to work with you on timing and payment terms.

### Do you offer monthly payment plans?
Currently, licenses are annual. However, we're open to discussing payment arrangements for qualifying organizations. Contact us!

### What happens if I don't pay?
We operate on the "be nice" guarantee. We trust that organizations using our software commercially will do the right thing. That said, we reserve all legal rights to enforce license compliance.

### Can I get a refund?
If you're not satisfied within 30 days of purchase, contact us. We'll work something out.

### Do contributors get paid or receive free licenses?
No. Contributors do not receive payment, royalties, or licensing fees. Contributing is voluntary, and all rights are assigned to the project owner. (You retain the right to use your contributions personally under the Community License if you qualify.)
